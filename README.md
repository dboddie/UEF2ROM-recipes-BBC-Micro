# UEF2ROM Recipes for the BBC Micro

This repository contains scripts to automate the process of downloading and
converting UEF files to ROMs using the UEF2ROM utility.

When hosted on GitHub, the GitHub Actions configuration should make it possible
for this process to be run on a server somewhere.

The result is that there should be build artifacts hidden somewhere within the
Actions tab. Find the latest successful build and click on it to see if you can
find them.

Alternatively, fork this repository, open the Actions tab, select the Make ROMs
workflow and trigger a new build.
